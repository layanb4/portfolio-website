Overview:

This website serves as a blog/portfolio page for the infamous Spongebob Squarepants. Spongebob has always wanted to start a blog and share his life with his friends. After learning how to code, he is creating his own website to practice his skills and share his life with others through images, writing, and links to his socials and other websites/videos.

Technology stacks:
For this website, html and css were used for the development of the project. For the wireframe, which is located in images, figma was used to design the website.

Liscene Used:
I chose to use the MIT liscence as it is the easiest to understand the restriction is one of the most commonly used liscence. It also gives me the freedom to do what I want with the software that I have created such as reusing and modifying.
