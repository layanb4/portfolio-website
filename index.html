    <p>Hello there! Welcome to my blog! I am Spongebob Squarepants and I will be sharing my life with you through my blog. I recently started to learn how to code and want to
        apply the knowledge that I learnt into this blog.I also love my supporters and would love to feel more connected with them.

    <p>This photo has great meaning to me. It was the first perfect krabby patty I have ever made. It was in my first year 
        of working in the Krusty Krabs. I had been training with Mr.Krabbs for a few months and was finally able to master it! The assemlbing part
        of the burger took time but this was the first time I was able to perfect it. First I placed the lettuce, then tomatoes, pickles, patty, and finally the 
        delicous sesame bun!!! Now after working there for more than 20 years, I can finally say I can effortlessly create hundreds of perfect krabby patties per day.

    <p>This day was truly the best day EVERRRRRRR. I hund out with my best best besttt friends patrick, squidward, sandy, and snail. We
        all went together to do my favourite activity of all time...PLAYING WITH JELLYFISH. We were able to catch many jelly fish but only one stayed with us.

        Here is a photo of my lovely home. Oh boy, how I love it so much. I moved to my beautful pineapple 20 years ago and have been living there ever since. So many great memories create here.
        I was able to make it all nice and homey by adding rocks on the path, decoration in the inside, and paintings. It would lovely for you all to join me someday. The best part of my house 
        is my neighours.... PATRICK AND SQUIDWARDDDDDD. How how I love to visit them all the time AHAHAHHAHAHAHH.
